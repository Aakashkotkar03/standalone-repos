Purpose:
This Python script is designed to process Google Analytics 4 (GA4) website data stored in an Excel file. The primary goal is to facilitate data analysis and gain insights from the website's traffic patterns.

How It Works:
1. Data Import:
   - The script imports the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation and numpy for numerical operations.
   - It reads the GA4 website data from an Excel file into a pandas DataFrame.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - The script preprocesses the data by filtering and standardizing certain columns.
   - It separates referral and organic traffic based on the 'sessionSource' column.
   - It extracts relevant information from the 'pagePath' column to categorize website pages.

3. Categorization:
   - The script categorizes website pages into predefined categories such as Politics News, Sports News, etc.
   - It consolidates similar categories and assigns them appropriate labels for better analysis.

4. Aggregation and Analysis:
   - The script aggregates website traffic metrics such as total users, screen page views, sessions, event count, and average session duration.
   - It creates a pivot table to summarize the aggregated data by category.
   - The pivot table is sorted based on the total number of users in descending order.
   - Percentage of users for each category is calculated to provide relative proportions.

5. Output:
   - The resulting pivot table is printed to the console for immediate analysis.
   - Additionally, the pivot table is exported to an Excel file named 'English_pivot_table.xlsx' for further exploration.

6. Note:
   - It's important to note that the script assumes a specific structure and naming conventions in the input data (e.g., column names, data format).
   - Users should customize the category mappings and aggregation functions according to their specific requirements and data characteristics.

Usage:
- Ensure that the input Excel file ('english.xlsx') contains GA4 website data with the required columns.
- Run the script in a Python environment with pandas and numpy installed.
- Review the printed pivot table and the exported Excel file for insights into website traffic patterns.
